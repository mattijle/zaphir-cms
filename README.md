# Zaphir-CMS

A primitive CMS. 

This is mostly just a training project for myself to learn how [nestjs](https://nestjs.com) operates. I would highly advice against using this in any kind of production environment.


### TODO:
- Graphql API
- User Role checks
- admin module/dashboard?
- frontend, so far we are headless.
- proper tests
